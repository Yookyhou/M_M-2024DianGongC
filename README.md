# Problem B: Optimization Design and Evaluation of Balanced Dietary Recipes for College Students

The college years are a crucial period for acquiring knowledge and physical development, as well as for forming good dietary habits. Young people in this age group require adequate energy and various nutrients for their physical growth, as well as substantial energy for their intensive mental work and physical exercise.

However, issues such as unreasonable dietary structures and poor eating habits are prominent among college students. This is evident in behaviors like skipping breakfast or eating poorly, frequently consuming takeout and fast food, and some students controlling their food intake to reduce subcutaneous fat, leading to malnutrition. Understanding nutrition and establishing healthy eating habits during college is essential for promoting growth and ensuring health.

A male and a female college student recorded their daily food intake for three meals, detailed in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. They want to assess whether their dietary nutrient intake is scientifically reasonable and what adjustments need to be made.

The meals provided by the university cafeteria are the main source of dietary nutrition for college students. Appendix 3 contains a statistical table of the main foods available in a university cafeteria for one day.

There are clear basic requirements for analyzing and evaluating the nutrients in the given dietary recipes, as well as for the optimization design of balanced dietary recipes, as detailed in Appendix 4.

Based on the balanced dietary guidelines and reference intake amounts for energy and various nutrients in Appendix 4, students are required to address the following issues following the "Nutritional Evaluation Process" and "Principles of Balanced Dietary Recipe Optimization":

## Problem 1: Nutritional Analysis and Adjustment of Dietary Recipes
1. Conduct a comprehensive nutritional evaluation of the recipes in Appendices 1 and 2.
2. Based on Appendix 3, make minimal adjustments to the recipes in Appendices 1 and 2, followed by a comprehensive nutritional evaluation.

## Problem 2: Optimization Design of Daily Balanced Dietary Recipes Based on Appendix 3
1. Establish an optimization model aimed at maximizing protein amino acid scores, and design daily recipes for both male and female students, including a nutritional evaluation.
2. Establish an optimization model aimed at minimizing meal costs, and design daily recipes for both male and female students, including a nutritional evaluation.
3. Establish an optimization model that balances protein amino acid scores and cost-effectiveness, and design daily recipes for both male and female students, including a nutritional evaluation.
4. Conduct comparative analysis of the daily recipes obtained from 1) to 3).

## Problem 3: Optimization Design of Weekly Balanced Dietary Recipes Based on Appendix 3
Building on Problem 2, establish optimization models aimed at maximizing protein amino acid scores, minimizing meal costs, and balancing both for designing weekly recipes (Monday to Sunday) for both male and female students, including evaluations and comparative analysis.

## Problem 4: Propose a Healthy Eating and Balanced Diet Initiative Addressing College Students' Dietary Structures and Habits.

## Paper Writing Requirements:
1. All source codes should be placed in the appendix at the end of the paper.
2. All basic data, solution process data, and final data should be included in the main text.
